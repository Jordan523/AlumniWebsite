-Added ability to display highlights and test login funcitons.
-Added a new navigation bar from the template on Canvas, hopefully integrating our site further with everyone else.
-Working on retrieving info from the Admin and User tables. Checking to see , when they login, if they should be redirected to an Admin page or the Alumni Home page. 

-Working on a window to display the Highlights in a comfortable format. This will either be another page that will display all the information from the highlight, or a window that opens within the current tab that a user can scroll through to view the highlight ina larger format.

IMPORTANT
-Disregard now. Everything I mentioned in previous pushes has been resolved;  that is, all problems from previous pushes. The above list is still valid.
